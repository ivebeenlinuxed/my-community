My Community
============

Please read README_TECHNICAL.md for developer information on building and testing the project


Welcome to My Community, an open source project allowing councils and other groups
to provide a portal to activities within the local area. Our aim is to engage all
groups, both community and council, by providing a central point of reference for
anything else in the area.

This project is currently being run in conjunction with Cheshire Age UK.


Goals
-----

Out of this project we are looking to setup a fully searchable portal of micro-sites
for each group, with support for each of these groups to brand their page as they see
fit. We will be providing functionality to enable groups to register a domain name
with their page, and also to be able to customise it with their own pictures, and
select the widgets that they wish to display, and the position they wish to display
them.

The tool will be useable by all age demographics and should be simple for those not
used to using technology. This type of development will mean that at times ease of
use will be prioritised over functionality.


How the system is designed
--------------------------

We have designed the system to work with a basis of three main entities:

* Venues - A place where things occur
* Groups - A collection of people organising activities
* Events - A link between a venue and a group, encorporating a time element

The strategy is to build the project around these three core elements. While other
entities may be created in the future, such as "people", these core entities will
form the basis of the core functionality.


How you can help
----------------

###Tell us when something is wrong

Although this is a technical project, you do not have to be technical to get involved.
If you notice an issue, for example a link does not work, please it for us to review.
You may be thinking this is difficult, but actually all you have to do is three things:

1. Register with GitHub
2. Click "Issues" at the top of this project page, then "Report an Issue"
3. Explain in your own words how you came across the issue so that we can repeat
the instructions to work out where it is going wrong

###Donate to the project

We have been given a large grant for this project, but will also welcome more support.
Open Source projects work by creating a project which anyone can join in with, but providing
the support around the outside is the commercial side of the project.

We are able to link the site up to print media, do marketing, link with community groups,
work with focus groups, organise hack days and much more to customise this basic project
into something which is suitable for your own needs. If you would like to discuss this further
please contact will@bcslichfield.com to discuss this and other options.

If you would like to give a donation towards a certain feature, this is also possible
by contacting the email above.

###Spread the word

Even if you are not technical, you can still share, follow and email people in your organisation
about the project. If you do feel you could give technical expertise within your organisation,
or know someone who could, we're always looking for open source coding enthusiasts as well!
